📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a high-precision predictive model to forecast taxi demand within one-hour windows at airports. By analyzing historical request data, the model helps service providers optimize vehicle allocation and reduce passenger wait times.

🚀 Key Features
Time Series Analysis: Processed historical data to identify daily and weekly seasonality.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Evaluated multiple architectures (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) to find the optimal configuration.

Performance Optimization: Achieved high accuracy with a reduced number of training epochs through efficient data dimension adjustments.

📊 Technical Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib/Seaborn.

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Git.

📈 Results & Impact
Metric: Achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 43.7 orders.

Performance: The model consistently stayed below the error target, outperforming baseline statistical methods.

Value: Provided actionable insights for real-time fleet adjustments based on hourly forecasts.
